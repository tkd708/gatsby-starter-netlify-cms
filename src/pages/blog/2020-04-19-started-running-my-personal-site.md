I developed my own personal site using Gatsby + Netlify. I will update the site with my research progresses and software (basically web and mobile apps) developed! I hope running this site would be helpful to spread my ideas to those who might be interested... and essentially for myself to forge my vision or mission by integrating my activities.

I'm up for any potential collaboration. So feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions! :)
