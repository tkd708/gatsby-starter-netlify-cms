He is currently studying for a PhD programme at Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia) on “Denitrification losses in relation to N fertiliser rates in Australian sugarcane systems”. The research consists of field experiments on commercial sugarcane farms in Queensland and simulation analyses using APSIM. The field experiments measure (1) Greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CH4 and CO2) by the automated-chamber system, (2) fertiliser N recoveries by 15N enriched fertiliser, (3) denitrification losses (N2+N2O) using the 15N gas flux method. Simulation analyses would extrapolate the field observation to assess N fertiliser rate strategies in terms of N2O emissions and N use efficiency across Australian sugarcane systems.


## Sugar industry in Australia

The higherst production among the cereal crops. Highest yield in Tolima depertment.


## Automated chamber system for GHG measurement

1. N2O, CO2, CH4
2. GC
3. Automatic gas sampling
4. High temporal resolution


## Fertiliser N recovery

Fertiliser N recovery in the plant and the soil, as well as the overall fertiliser N loss

## N2 & N2O

15N gas flux method to measure denitrification losses under field conditions.
