  title: '"Coloured" by your own interest'
  description: >
    This website is dedicated to demonstrate coloured maps of the world. At the
    moment, I'm trying to make some maps related to my own topics... such as
    agricultural productions, geography, development issues, cultural aspects,
    etc. I hope to make this site interactive by allowing visitors to make thier
    own coloured map!

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
